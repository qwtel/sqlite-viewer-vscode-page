card3P: >
  Insert or delete one or more rows using the modal dialog, the explorer, or keyboard shortcuts.
card4H: "Undo and redo changes using VS Code"

card5H: "Works in containers, SSH, and WSL"
card5P: >
  SQLite Viewer PRO can be installed inside containers, SSH hosts, and WSL instances. A native SQLite instance
  runs alongside your database in the remote workspace, while only the webview remains on the local machine.
sectionTitleI: "Re-Engineered From the Ground Up for PRO Demands"
sectionParagraphI: >
  You can think of the PRO version as _SQLite Viewer 2_.
  It's not just feature flags, but a completely new engine under the hood. Comes with SQLite failover guarantees and large file support.
feat1H: "Native SQLite Client"
feat1P: >
  The PRO version uses the __official SQLite implementation__, which provides the full set of failover guarantees.
  The old read-only client remains as a fallback.
feat2H: "Unlimited File Size"
feat2P: >
  All restrictions on file size are lifted, __even during remote sessions__. Only the data needed to render the UI
  is transferred to your local machine.
feat3H: "Ad-Free Experience"
feat3P: >
  PRO customers enjoy an ad-free experience — __perfect for screen sharing and recordings__. Additionally, PRO customers
  receive an exclusive PRO icon <span class="nb">({icon})</span> in the UI.
sectionTitleIi: "Includes Everything You Like About the Free Version"

  and provides as many features as possible.

faq1Summary: How do I install the PRO version after the purchase?
faq1Content: >
  You already have the PRO version installed! All that's required is to activate it. After the purchase is complete, you will receive an email from the
  merchant of record with instructions on how to claim the license key. __Activation happens within VS Code itself and only takes a couple of seconds__:<br><br>
  Open the __Command Palette__ and type __"Activate License Key"__. Alternatively, you can open the __"Upgrade to PRO"__ dialog within a SQLite Viewer tab,
  scroll to the bottom of the page and click __"Enter License Key"__. An input field will open at the top of the VS Code window. Paste the license key and hit enter.
  A system dialog will confirm the activation within a few seconds.
faq2Summary: Can I use the PRO version on multiple devices?
faq2Content: >
  You can activate SQLite Viewer PRO on an unlimited number of devices, and use it on up to 3 devices simultaneously.<br><br>
  There are some restrictions on activation frequency, but these are solely in place to prevent key sharing/publishing and other misuse.
  _The vast majority of customers never encounter any licensing issues_.
faq3Summary: How does offline license activation work?
faq3Content: >
  When selecting __"Offline License Activation"__ from the __Command Palette__, you will be redirected to the offline activation page.
  _You can open this page on any device_. Enter your license key and you will receive an activation token.
  You can then send this token to the intended device through any channel (e.g. email, Slack) 
  and paste it into the input field at the end of the Offline License Activation wizard.<br><br>
  Devices enrolled through this method will never attempt to connect to the license server, 
  provided a Business Edition key was used and the "Business Edition evaluation" checkbox was not checked when generating the token.
footnote1: "Offline Activation is required if a company firewall prevents the extension from connecting to the license server."
footnote2: "When a device is enrolled through offline activation, the extension can be used without ever needing to connect to the license server."
