sectionTitleI: "Re-Engineered From the Ground Up for PRO Demands"
sectionParagraphI: >

  It's not just feature flags, but a completely new engine under the hood. Comes with SQLite failover guarantees and large file support.
feat1H: "Native SQLite Client"

  The PRO version uses the __official SQLite implementation__, which provides the full set of failover guarantees.
  The old read-only client remains as a fallback.
feat2H: "Unlimited File Size"
feat2P: >
  All restrictions on file size are lifted, __even during remote sessions__. Only the data needed to render the UI
  is transferred to your local machine.
feat3H: "Ad-Free Experience"

faq1Summary: How do I install the PRO version after the purchase?
faq1Content: >
  You already have the PRO version installed! All that's required is to activate it. After the purchase is complete, you will receive an email from the
  merchant of record with instructions on how to claim the license key. _Activation happens within VS Code itself and only takes a couple of seconds_:<br><br>
  Open the __Command Palette__ and type __"Activate License Key"__. Alternatively, you can open the __"Upgrade to PRO"__ dialog within a SQLite Viewer tab,
  scroll to the bottom of the page and click __"Enter License Key"__. An input field will open at the top of the VS Code window. Paste the license key and hit enter.
  A system dialog will confirm the activation within a few seconds.
faq2Summary: Can I use the PRO version on multiple devices?
faq2Content: >
  You can activate SQLite Viewer PRO on an _unlimited number of devices_, and use it on _up to 3 devices simultaneously_.<br><br>
  There are some restrictions on activation frequency, but these are solely in place to prevent key sharing/publishing and other misuse.
  _The vast majority of customers never encounter any licensing issues_.
faq3Summary: How does offline license activation work?
faq3Content: >
  When selecting __"Offline License Activation"__ from the __Command Palette__, you will be redirected to the offline activation page.
  _You can open this page on any device_. Enter your license key and you will receive an activation token.
  You can then send this token to the intended device through any channel (e.g. email, Slack, USB dongle) 
  and paste it into the input field at the end of the Offline License Activation wizard. No internet connection is required to verify the token.<br><br>
  Devices enrolled through this method will never attempt to connect to the license server, 
  provided a Business Edition key was used and the "Business Edition evaluation" checkbox was not checked when generating the token.
faq4Summary: What datetime formats are supported?
faq4Content: >
  SQLite Viewer PRO supports a wide range of datetime formats for columns defined as `DATE` or `DATETIME`. Supported input formats include:<br><br>
  ‚Ä¢ SQLite ISO-like strings<br>
  ‚Ä¢ ISO-8601 strings<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Julian Day numbers<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Seconds since 1970 (Unix timestamp)<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Milliseconds since 1970<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Microseconds since 1970<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Excel serial date (1900 system)<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Windows FILETIME since 1601<br>
  ‚Ä¢ .NET Ticks since 0001<br><br>
  When a valid date is recognized, it can be displayed in one of 4 formats:<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Localized, human-readable strings (default)<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Localized, human-readable time-ago strings (e.g. "6 months ago")<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Machine-friendly ISO-8601 strings<br>
  ‚Ä¢ Raw values<br><br>
  Values can be edited using a generic date picker or by modifying the interpreted ISO string. The extension preserves the original format when saving to disk.
faq5Summary: Can I use the PRO version to view production databases?
faq5Content: >
  Yes, but it is highly recommended that you make preparations.<br><br>
  If you intend to view data only, open the live database in read-only mode to prevent accidental modification. 
  Right-click the file, click __"Open With‚Ä¶"__ and select __"SQLite Viewer (read-only)"__.<br><br>
  If you intend to modify the live database, it is highly recommended to enable the __"Sqlite Viewer: Instant Commit"__ feature from the VS Code settings menu. 
  This will prevent the extension from opening long-running transactions that could block other SQLite processes accessing the same database.
  However, please note that undo/redo functionality can be limited in this mode.<br><br>
footnote1: "Offline Activation is required if a company firewall prevents the extension from connecting to the license server."
footnote2: "When a device is enrolled through offline activation, the extension can be used without ever needing to connect to the license server."
